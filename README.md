# School Projects 🏫 💻 🐯

This repo is a collection of some of my projects completed at LSU during my time as a Computer Science Student. I may come back from time to time to update things/refactor. 

Some other related repos that have not been moved here yet are my implementations of:

* [AVL Tree](https://github.com/avogel3/AVLTree)
* [Priority Queue](https://github.com/avogel3/PriorityQueue)
* [CSC4101 - Scheme Interpreter](https://github.com/avogel3/CSC4101)
